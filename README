# Purpose
This tool allows you to connect to quantic-telecom captive portal with one click !

# How-to ?
On the right side of github, click on the **Releases** section.
Download the jar file from the latest release.
Run the executable:
```
java -jar .\quanticconnect-no-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

It creates a file in quantic_connect_config/config.txt.
Fill it:
```
EMAIL=myEmail
PASSWORD=myPassword
URL=https://www.quantic-telecom.net/connexion-reseau
```

Now everytime you execute the jar file, it will reconnect you to quantic-telecom.net ! Just re-execute the following command:
```
java -jar .\quanticconnect-no-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
It is normal for javascript errors to appear. The script continue to be executed so don't worry about it.
